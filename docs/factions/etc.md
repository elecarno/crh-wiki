The primary regulatory body of the Draconan economy. The ETC hosts a series of trade facilities and acts as a political neutral-ground between the major factions. ETC naval assets are limited to a policing force that patrols each of its facilities. The corporation also had significant numbers of personell working in the territories of other factions to ensure that ETC trade policies are upheld, as well as aiding in difficult negotiations between the notoriously adversarial major powers.

## History
The ETC started as a colonial branch of the much larger Central Trade Corporation based in the Milky Way. In 41 BGC the CTC's primary body collapsed, leaving the Draconan branch to rename itself to the Geras Trade Corporation - setting up an economic center in the Geras system.

In 34 BGC the [DFU] launched an attack on the then GTC, disrupting the Draconan economy and leveraging economic control in order to negotiate access to the rest of the cluster.

When the [CAS] withdrew from Dracona in 30 BGC, control of Erebus was handed over to the GTC. Erebus would later become the capital system of the faction and the GTC renamed to the Erebus Trade Corporation after Geras was devastated during the [Frontier Civil War].

The ETC would again be attacked by the [SNC] in 82 AGC, only surviving due to re-inforcements from the [SSF] and [RGU], and once more in 159 AGC where the Erebus system was captured by [SNC] forces with the system being liberated during [Operation Scorched Stars] in 164 AGC.
