The modern counterpart to the [DFU], the FSA works as a high-level governmental body for the frontier. The FSA's primary stated goal is to prevent a second [Frontier Civil War] and to prevent intervention of the great powers within the frontier, although the extent to which it has been successful on that latter point is highly contested.
