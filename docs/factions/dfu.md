An alliance between the factions of the frontier regions that existed in the late [BGC] and early [AGC] eras. Although it is often thought of as a strongly united faction, it is more accurate to describe the DFU as a vague mutual-defence pact - although this notably changed during the [Frontier Independence War] where the leadership of [Jane Artell] and the early [FHC] brought the DFU together as a unified entity for the first time in its turbulent history.
