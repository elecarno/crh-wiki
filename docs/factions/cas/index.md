Despite spearheading the colonisation of the Draconis Cluster in both funding and manpower, the CAS remains as one of the most elusive and mysterious factions in the history of Dracona. Formerly a major power in the Milky Way galaxy, the CAS controlled an ancient religion said to have originated from the home system of humanity itself, with many of the systems in Dracona eventually coming to be named after the various deities of this religion.

The most notable lasting impact of the CAS can be seen in the powerful jump gates that dictate the primary routes of transport throughout the cluster. The technology in these jump gates has since been lost to time, yet they are known to far-exceed the capabilities of any modern counterpart - notably being able to connect the vast distances between the stellar north, stellar center, and the frontier with a single fast and reliable gate.

## History
The CAS were the first to enter Dracona in 112 [BGC], beginning work on charting the cluster and constructing jump gates to permanently connect the region. These jump gates were completed in 98 [BGC], and the CAS settled into a territory of four systems: [Hades], [Persephone], [Charon], and [Erebus].

By 30 [BGC], it is believed that the CAS experienced some unknown adversity back in the Milky Way, and as such eventually decides to stop directly supporting its branch in Dracona. Seven years later in 21 [BGC], CAS entirely collapses beginning a refugee crisis across the cluster as CAS citizens flee the now turbulent territories.

Eventually, remnants of the CAS would merge with hardliners from the recently reformed [ISC] to form the [SNC].
