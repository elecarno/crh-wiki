## Clear Skies
Clear Skies was a political movement present within the [ISC] between 18 and 20 [AGC]. The movement advocated for a restructuring of the [ISC]'s government -- with the removal of the monarch and greater control placed intto the hands of the lower noble houses. The movement was also built upon a pacifist ideology -- originating from the *Clear Cascadian Skies* movement (see below) -- with many wishing for the [ISC] to withdraw from the [Frontier Independence War].

# Clear Cascadian Skies
Clear Cascadian Skies was a political movement originating from the planet [Cascadia] sometime in 15 [AGC]. The movement originated from a strong opposition to the major military presence active on the planet at the time and advocated for a significant demilitarisation of the world.
