# False Promise
The False Promise is the name given to a cultural sentiment that emerged in the [Frontier] around 3 [AGC], shortly after the [Gate Closure]. It encapsulates the concept that the idea sold to many minor factions that [Draconis Cluster] would be an escape from the turbulent and monopolised political landscape of the Milky Way does not reflect reality and was no more than a marketing tactic employed by the larger factions in order to remove potential competition.

The term itself was coined in the influential book, *[The False Promise]* written by the elusive author [Q.] in 3 [AGC].
