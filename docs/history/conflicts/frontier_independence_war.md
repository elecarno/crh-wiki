# Frontier Independence War (14 - 31 AGC)

| Belligerents |              |
|:-------------|:-------------|
| [FHC], [DFU] | [SSF], [ISC] |

With an almost seamless transition from the [Frontier Civil War], the Frontier Independence War initially started as an invasion of the [Frontier] by an alliance formed between the [SSF] and [ISC], with the two factions seeking to take advantage of the deteriorating state of the [DFU] to attempt to sieze control of the [Frontier].

The initial invasion by the [SSF]-[ISC] alliance would eventually become an all out war when [Jane Artell] united the [Free Helion Peoples](../../factions/fhc.html) into the [FHC] and rallied the remaining [DFU] factions to defend the sovereignty of the [Frontier].
