# First SNC Crusade (67 - 82 [AGC])

| Belligerents        | |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| [SNC] | [SSF], [RGU], [GTC] |

The First SNC Crusade was a religious and territorial conquest by the [SNC] against the major powers controlling the [Draconis Cluster] at the time. The campaign was centered on the [Stellar North], with the [SNC] launching its invasions from previously hidden stations in the [Stellar West]. The [SNC]'s primary goals were to capture the systems of [Hypnos Organa] and [Hypnos Aria], both of which the faction claimed were of great significance to the newly founded faith of [Ampherity].
