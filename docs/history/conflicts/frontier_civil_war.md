# Frontier Civil War (5 - 12 AGC)
Also known as: "DFU Civil War".

The Frontier Civil War was fought between the member factions of the [DFU], as well as other minor factions active in the [Frontier] at the time. The conflict was sparked by the significant strain placed on the resources of the [Frontier] at the time due to the cutoff of intergalactic trade after the [Gate Closure]. Combined with the relative poverty of the [Frontier] when compared to the rest of the [Draconis Cluster], and the effects of the [False Promise], created a highly unstable situation in the region.

It is unknown exactly which factions fired the first rounds, yet it is believed that the fighting began in the [Leto] system and spread outwards across the [Frontier] from there.
