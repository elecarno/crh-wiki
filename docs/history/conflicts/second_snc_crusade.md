# Second SNC Crusade (153 - 184 AGC)

The Second SNC Crusade was a religious and territorial campaign launched by the [SNC] with the intent of annexing its remaining claims which it was unsuccesful in securing from the [First SNC Crusade]. This second war was considerably more destructive than its predecessor, with the theatre spanning across the [Stellar North], [West], and [Core], along with the considerable uptick in military investment across the [Draconis Cluster]. Another factor which contributed to the conflict's devastating effects was the [SNC]'s numerous alliances with smaller factions -- particularly in the [Stellar Core] region.
