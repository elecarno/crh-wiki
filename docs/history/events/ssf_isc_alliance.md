# Alliance of the SSF and ISC (12 - 20 [AGC])
Shortened to SSF-ISC. Began as a pact of mutual defence signed by the [SSF] and [ISC] with the express goal of preventing conflicts originating in the [Frontier] region (namely the [Frontier Civil War] at the time) from spreading to the rest of the [Draconis Cluster], whether that be by direct conflict or proxy wars. This initially manifested in the [blockade of the Frontier](../../history/conflicts/frontier_civil_war.html#blockade-of-the-frontier-5-agc), with [SSF] and [ISC] forces blocking all traffic from entering or exiting the [Myca] system.

Following the [DFU]'s operation [Crossroads] however, the alliance quickly shifted to take a more offensive stance -- launching an [Invasion of the Frontier] and beginning the [Frontier Independence War] in 14 [AGC]. The ratification of this offensive-focused alliance is often viewed as the true formation of the SSF-ISC, with the previous pact being only a loose agreement between the two factions.
