# CAS Refugee Crisis (21 [BGC])
Following the full withdrawal of the [CAS] from the [Draconis Cluster], the populations of the occupied [CAS] territories found themselves without institutions or government and the former [CAS] society was plunged into almost immediate chaos. From here, the inhabitants of [Hades], [Persephone], [Charon], and [Erebus] began fleeing en masse to the surounding systems, placing an immense strain on the infrastructure and resources of the [Draconis Cluster].
