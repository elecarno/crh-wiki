# Operation Crossroads (9 [AGC])
*Crossroads* was a naval operation enacted by member factions of the [DFU] during the [Frontier Civil War]. The operation aimed to be a two-pronged attack to break through the [blockade](../../history/conflicts/frontier_civil_war.html#blockade-of-the-frontier-5-agc) encated upon the [Frontier] by the [SSF] and [ISC], with the hopes that connection to the rest of the [Draconis Cluster] may dampen or even stop the [Frontier Civil War].

The [DFU] aimed to initiate a simultaneous suprise attack on the systems of [Geras] (controlled by the [SSF]) and [Moros] (controlled by the [ISC]). [SSF] and [ISC] forces proved to be significantly more capable than the those of the [DFU] however (as the [DFU] had already been fighting in the [civil war] for four years), and in retaliation the major powers pushed the the [DFU] back to the [Myca] system, and then proceeded to capture the sytem itself.
