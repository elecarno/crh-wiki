# Destabilisation of the ISC (c. 18 - 20 [AGC])
As the [Frontier Independence War] dragged on, a significant anti-war sentiment began to grow amongst the population of the [ISC]. Both the noble houses and the so-called "common folk" of the [ISC] had become tired of wartime economic restrictions -- with the latter especially unhappy at no longer being able to maintain the decadent lifestyle much of the upper [ISC] had become accustomed to. Many leaders within the [ISC]'s aristocracy were also becoming increasingly uncomfortable with contributing their fleets to the war effort, as both the [SSF] and [ISC] had experienced disproportionately higher losses than had been estimated over the course of the war.

This sentiment was first solidified with the formation of the [Clear Cascadian Skies] movement -- originating from the planet of [Cascadia] which held the largest complex of [ISC] military installations of any [ISC] world at the time. As the movement spread throughout the [ISC] however, it would eventually grow to become the more prominent [Clear Skies] movement -- which would go on to overthrow the [ISC] monarchy and from the [RGU] in 26 [AGC].
