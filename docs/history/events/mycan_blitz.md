# Mycan Blitz (34 [BGC])
The *Mycan Blitz* was a [DFU] naval operation in which the faction launched an attack on the then [GTC] controlled [Myca] system (now known as [New Helios]) and successfully captured it. This stopped the [GTC] trade blockade against the [Frontier] and allowed the region to gain greater access to the wider economy in the [Draconis Cluster] during the turbulent [Colonial Collapse].
