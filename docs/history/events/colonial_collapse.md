# Colonial Collapse (c. 41 - 1 [BGC])
The Colonial Collapse refers to the latter half of the Colonial Era of the [Draconis Cluster] when the major factions of the time (primarily the [SSF], [ISC], [CTC], and [CAS]) began cutting investments into the Cluster or outright abandoning it entirely. The period is said to have co-incided with an era of turmoil in the Milky Way galaxy, acting as another contributing factor to the gradual weakening of the major powers both in the [Draconis Cluster] and the Milky Way.
